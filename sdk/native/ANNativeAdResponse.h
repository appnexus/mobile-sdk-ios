 * Contains native ad assets as well as defines the process by which a native view can be registered for impression
 * tracking and click handling.
 *
 * After the response is received as part of the [ANNativeAdRequest delegate] callback, a native view can
 * be created and the native ad elements populated. When the view is ready for display, it should be
 * registered with the response, and a delegate can optionally be attached to the response for callbacks
 * related to actions on the native view. Here is a sample workflow:
 *
 * @code
 * - (void)adRequest:(ANNativeAdRequest *)request didReceiveResponse:(ANNativeAdResponse *)response {
 *      (code which loads the view)
 *      MyDummyView *view;
 *      view.title.text = response.title;
 *      view.text.text = response.body;
 *      view.iconImageView.image = response.iconImage;
 *      view.mainImageView.image = response.mainImage;
 *      [view.callToActionButton setTitle:response.callToAction forState:UIControlStateNormal];
 *
 *      response.delegate = self;
 *
 *      [response registerViewForTracking:view
 *                 withRootViewController:self
 *                         clickableViews:@[view.callToActionButton, view.mainImageView]
 *                                  error:nil];

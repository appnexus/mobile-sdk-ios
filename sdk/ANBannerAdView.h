#pragma mark - Example implementation

/**
 This view displays ads from placements that return banner, video and/or native ads.
 Note the implementation requires delaying the point where the ad is displayed,
   because native ads are displayed with ANNativeAdResponse and because the type of ad must be
   tested after load in order to determine the proper means for display.

 @code
    ANBannerAdView  *banner  = nil;

    - (void) loadMultiFormatAd
    {
        CGSize  size      = CGSizeMake(300, 250);  // NOTE  Setting size is necessary only for fetching banner and video ad objects.
                                                   //       This field is ignored when the placement returns a native ad object.
        CGRect  someRect  = CGRectMake(...);

        // Create the banner ad view here, but wait until the delegate fires before displaying.
        //
        ANBannerAdView  *banner  = [ANBannerAdView adViewWithFrame:someRect placementId:@"<YOUR_PLACEMENT_ID>" adSize:size];
        banner.rootViewController = self;

        // Load an ad!
        [banner loadAd];
    }

    // Display all multi-format ads in success method from ANBannerAdViewDelegate.
    //
    - (void) adDidReceiveAd:(id)adObject
    {
        if ([adObject isKindOfClass:[ANNativeAdResponse class]])
        {
            ANNativeAdResponse  *nativeAdResponse  = (ANNativeAdResponse *)ad;
            MyNativeView        *nativeView        = [[MyNativeView alloc] init];

            nativeView.title.text            = nativeAdResponse.title;
            nativeView.text.text             = nativeAdResponse.body;
            nativeView.iconImageView.image   = nativeAdResponse.iconImage;
            nativeView.mainImageView.image   = nativeAdResponse.mainImage;

            [nativeView.callToActionButton setTitle:response.callToAction forState:UIControlStateNormal];

            nativeAdResponse.delegate = self;

            [nativeAdResponse registerViewForTracking: nativeView
                              withRootViewController: self
                                      clickableViews: @[nativeView.callToActionButton, nativeView.mainImageView]
                                               error: nil
              ];

            [self.view addSubview:nativeView];

        } else {
            [self.view addSubview:banner];
        }
    }
 @endcode


 If this view will be displaying placements that include only banner and/or video ads,
   then display can be (optimistically) handled without using ANBannerAdViewDelegate:

 @code
    - (void) loadMultiFormatAdThatDoesNotIncludeNative
    {
        CGSize size = CGSizeMake(300, 250);

        // Create the banner ad view and add it as a subview.
        //
        ANBannerAdView  *banner  = [ANBannerAdView adViewWithFrame:rect placementId:@"13572468" adSize:size];
        banner.rootViewController = self;

        [self.view addSubview:banner];

        // Load an ad!
        // NOTE  Upon loadAd failure, the view impression simply remains blank.
        //
        [banner loadAd];
    }
 @endcode

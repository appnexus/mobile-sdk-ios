 *  @note Important: As usual according to the way `NSURLSessionConfiguration` works, you
 *        MUST set this property BEFORE creating the `NSURLSession`. Once the `NSURLSession`
 *        object is created, they use a deep copy of the `NSURLSessionConfiguration` object
 *        used to create them, so changing the configuration later does not affect already
 *        created sessions.
